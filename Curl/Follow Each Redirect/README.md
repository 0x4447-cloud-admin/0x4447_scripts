To run the script do the following:
# ./script.sh
The script will request a URL.
You have the option of putting a custom URL or taking the default (https://demo.0x4447.com)

The script then will print the following information:
1. Hierarchy of all re-directs
2. HEAD information (curl -I) for each redirect
