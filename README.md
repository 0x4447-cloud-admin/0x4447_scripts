# 0x4447-Scripts

We decided to share our scripts that we use while working on projects. If they work for us, and they help us finish a job faster, than why not share them with everyone to benefit. No need to re-invent the wheel.

# Repo Instructions

- Each folder must have a `README.md`.
- If we are dealing with a one-liner Linux CLI, then we add the command in the `README.md`.
- If we have a script, we make a `script.sh` file. Then, in the `README.md` we add an instruction how to run it.
